## Tech Talk 2

### Notes

* create a calculator class that calculates the expression by printing the result 
* reverse polish notation --> 3 + 4 becomes 3 4 + 
* nice because we can push them into a stack and then pop it out of a stack and then calculate the expression
* need the different mathmateical operator to put the operators (uses a hash map) 
* x and / are a higher precident then + and - 
* figure out the tokens and precedents for the operators 
* split the mathmateical expression into different tokens (each of independent meaning) 
* numbers have a token, paranthesis are a token, and operators are a token (etc) 
* write little routines that identify if the operator is a character an operator or seperator 
* first tokenize, second put them into second reverse polish notation, then put the numbers into a stack, have the operator come out and then pop out two numbers from the stack and calculate => put the number into the num list, and then it goes into to the second operator and then it pops out two numbers from the stack and then calculates that number (process and theoritcal) 
* peek is just looking at the data within the stack before popping it out

### Notes
* Tuple: key value pair 
* dictironary: hash map 
* stacks and ques are buit of off lists where lists are type of an array (similar properties grouped) 
* graphs and trees aren't used for the AP Exam
* nonlinear --> hash map is a nonlinear structure 
* focus more on the linear ones (typically enhance for loop) 
* nonlinear --> access more directly through the key and gives the value
* imperative vs procedural: coding language is set of statements where there is a sequence. 
* imperative --> sequence of steps to achieve a solution (takes by step by step (sequence of events choosen by choice) ) 
* procedural --> enhances the code (condenses the code) goes through a series of steps (decisions) 
* OOP programming: knows the object and its key properties (solve the problem by figuring out how the object interacts with the world)
* Imperative and OOP both have common data structures 
* data structures that have algorithms that are within a specific style depending on data structure algorithms will be done
* standardized simplify the code without adding too much complexity  

## Tech Talk 1
### Notes 
* linked lists: a connection to java objects (link one object to another object) 
* Generic T: <This is generic t>
* Iterable: enhance for loops where we go from one item to another item (enables the for each loop to work) 
* inqueue: adding things into the queue
* dequeue: deleting things from the back of the queue
* stack: last in first out
* implements: is like the extends keyword (but no definiton) is going to give some methods that need to be defined 
* setting the tail to the next node tail and then setting it as the new tail
