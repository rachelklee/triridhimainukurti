### Notes
* Tuple: key value pair 
* dictironary: hash map 
* stacks and ques are buit of off lists where lists are type of an array (similar properties grouped) 
* graphs and trees aren't used for the AP Exam
* nonlinear --> hash map is a nonlinear structure 
* focus more on the linear ones (typically enhance for loop) 
* nonlinear --> access more directly through the key and gives the value
* imperative vs procedural: coding language is set of statements where there is a sequence. 
* imperative --> sequence of steps to achieve a solution (takes by step by step (sequence of events choosen by choice) ) 
* procedural --> enhances the code (condenses the code) goes through a series of steps (decisions) 
* OOP programming: knows the object and its key properties (solve the problem by figuring out how the object interacts with the world)
* Imperative and OOP both have common data structures 
* data structures that have algorithms that are within a specific style depending on data structure algorithms will be done
* standardized simplify the code without adding too much complexity
